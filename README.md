# FlyAway
Computer Graphics Project

Our project is an engaging computer graphics-based game where players control a bird navigating through pipes by flapping its wings. Developed in C++ using the OpenGL library, the game employs a graphics window displaying bird, pipes, and background using 2D shapes.

The bird's movements are animated with a series of images controlled through user input via keyboard and mouse.

Collision detection ensures gameplay integrity by detecting bird-pipe collisions. The game incorporates a scoring system, incremented with each successful gap navigation, calculated using straightforward arithmetic operations.
